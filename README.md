# Working-With-Data-and-Code-A2

This is my A2:

The first link takes you to the complete original song I coded on Tunepad, and the second link takes you to my adaption. To interact, press the play button in the top right corner to play all the cells at once, or press the play button on the individual cells on the right hand side of the screen. There are relevant comments throughout the code, to explain what the code means and how it's working.
